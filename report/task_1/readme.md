##  Steps Followed

1. **Installed Nmap** from pacman
2. **Identified local IP address**:
   - `192.168.229.36/24`
3. **Ran TCP SYN scan** across the subnet:
   ```bash
   nmap -sS 192.168.229.0/24 -oN nmap_result.txt
   ```
4. Extracted scan results for active hosts

5. Performed in-depth analysis of open ports and services

6. Identified security risks

7. Saved and documented findings in this repository
