## 3. Key Observations

**Short/weak passwords (e.g., "password123"):**
- Cracked instantly or in seconds
- Common in breaches
- Rated "Very Weak"

**Moderate passwords (e.g., "Summer2025!"):**
- Improved cracking time (1 hrs)
- Still predictable due to dictionary words

**Strong passwords (e.g., "#Xr9@2Lq!8e*T7"):**
- Time to crack extended to decades or centuries
- High entropy
- Rated "Strong" or "Very Strong"
